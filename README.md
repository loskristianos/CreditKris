# Class final project - banking application

## Project Stages (~~initial~~ revised/mostly abandoned plan) 

~~- Stage 1 - CLI only, csv (or similar) data storage~~
~~- Stage 1 - CLI only, database data storage~~
- Stage ~~2~~ - GUI ~~and CLI~~, database data storage
- Stage 3 - password hashes/encryption/security/etc.
- Stage 4 - refactor and move text strings etc. to a resources folder for future localization/easier changes to wording[^1]

[^1]: This should probably (ideally)[^2] be done between v2 and v3 because the GUI will use a lot of the same text strings as the CLI, so it makes sense to have them both refer to the same string rather than duplicate hard-coded text. 
[^2]: *Ideally* ideally it should be done like this from the start.
